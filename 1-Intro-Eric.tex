This course studies the Hitchin system from different perspectives and in various settings.

Hitchin studied a limiting form of the self-dual equations of Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions,
imposing invariance under two of the dimensions.  The resulting equations were found to be
conformally invariant with respect to the remaining two directions, so had a natural formulation
as equations on a Riemann surface.  The Hitchin moduli space, or moduli space of Higgs bundles,
will be defined as the space of solutions modulo gauge transformations.

Several basic properties of the space of solutions emerged.  First, the equations could be
interpreted formally as hyperkahler moment map equations for the compact gauge Group action
on the infinite-dimensional space of connections.  Since we quotient solutions by gauge
transformations, this means we have an interpretation of the Hithchin moduli space as a hyperkahler
quotient.  Thus it should inherit a hyperkaher structure.  Of the three independent complex structures,
the one most amenable to algebraic geometry is the one inherited from the complex
structue on the Riemann surface, $C$.  In that setting, the Hitchin moduli space has an
interpretation as stable Higgs pairs, i.e. pairs $(V,\varphi)$, where $V$ is a rank-$n$ holomorphic
vector bundle over $C$, and $\varphi\in \Gamma(End(V)\otimes K_C)$ is a holomorphic $n\times n$
matrix-valued one-form.  Stability requires that all $\varphi$-invariant sub-bundles have lesser slope
than $V$.  Finally, solutions are taken modulo holomorphic isomorphism of vector bundles.

Another structure which emerges is that of an algebraically completely integrable system.
Recall first that a complete integrable system on a symplectic manifold (``phase space'') is a
maximal set of Poisson-commuting proper functions (``Hamiltonians").  Specifying the values
of these conserved quantities gives a common level set which is a Lagrangian torus.
This gives another definition:  a fibration by Lagrangian tori to a base manifold where the
Hamiltonians take their values.  The fiber map for the Hitchin space is defined by all the
invariant polynomials $Tr\varphi^k$.
