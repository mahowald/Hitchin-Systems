# Hitchin-Systems
These are the notes from our Hitchin Systems seminar course in Spring 2015.

Edit the HitchinSystems.tex file with updates from your talk! (You can either edit the file directly, or just paste notes from your own local tex file). Please check that the document still compiles before you commit your changes (e.g., by downloading the .tex file with your changes and compiling it).
